        <h1>An Essay about Cow</h1>
        <p>The cow is a domestic animal one sees every day. Cows are found worldwide in various shapes, colours, and sizes. There are more than 1000 cow breeds in the world. Cows are the female mammal, and the male cow is called the Ox or Bull. A male cow’s child is known as a ‘Calf,’ while a female cow’s child is known as a ‘Heifer.’ Like most animals, cows have two eyes and ears, a nose, a long tail, four limbs, and two sharp horns. People keep cows at home for various reasons, including the provision of milk and making other dairy products from that milk. Cows are also bred for ploughing the fields or pulling the carts. They are peaceful animals, and are gentle and caring in nature.</p>
